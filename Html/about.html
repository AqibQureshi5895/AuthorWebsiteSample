        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <section>
          <p>Hi there and welcome!</p>
          <p>
            I am Ryan Holiday and I am a writer and media strategist. When I was
            19 years old, I dropped out of college to apprentice under Robert
            Greene, author of The 48 Laws of Power. I had a successful marketing
            career at American Apparel and went on to found a creative agency
            called Brass Check, which has advised clients like Google, TASER,
            and Complex, as well as many prominent bestselling authors,
            including Neil Strauss, Tony Robbins and Tim Ferriss. I am the
            author of ten books, including The Obstacle Is the Way, Ego Is the
            Enemy, The Daily Stoic, Conspiracy and Stillness is the Key which
            have sold more than 2 million copies in thirty languages and have a
            following among NFL coaches, world-class athletes, TV personalities,
            political leaders, and others around the world. I spend much of my
            time on a ranch outside Austin, Texas where I do my writing and work
            in between raising cattle, donkeys and goats..
          </p>

            I originally started this blog nearly ten years ago to help me along
            in my journey of self-education. I wanted to write what I wished
            other blogs would talk about more often: life, dealing with
            assholes, how to be self-critical and self-aware, humility,
            philosophy, reading, learning, research and strategy. Aside from
            this site, I have written for the New York Times, USA Today, New
            York Observer, Thought Catalog, Entrepreneur, Fast Company, The
            Huffington Post, Medium, Boing Boing, Forbes, Columbia Journalism
            Review and many other outlets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, most people subscribe to my work via email—about 200,000
            people get it emailed directly to their inbox wherever I happen to
            publish them. I’d like to invite you to sign up and get them too
            (you can also reply and chat with me about anything I’ve written).
            As a welcome, I will instantly send you a free PDF collection of my
            most viral and popular articles designed to help you be more
            productive, strategic and successful. I can’t take credit for
            everything in them—because one of my strategies is to borrow from
            the smartest people I know. My tips and tricks include helpful hints
            from a wide range of people like filmmaker Casey Neistat, my editor
            Niki Papadopoulos, my wife Samantha and authors like Tim Ferriss,
            Nassim Taleb and Robert Greene. Just sign up below and I look
            forward to chatting!
