          How did the movie The Shawshank Redemption fail at the box office but

          How is Iron Maiden still filling stadiums worldwide without radio or

        <p>
          Bestselling author and marketer Ryan Holiday calls such works and
          artists perennial sellers. How do they endure and thrive while most
          books, movies, songs, video games, and pieces of art disappear quickly
          after initial success? How can we create and market creative works
          that achieve longevity?
        </p>
        <p>
          Holiday explores this mystery by drawing on his extensive experience
          working with businesses and creators such as Google, American Apparel,
          and the author John Grisham, as well as his interviews with the minds
          behind some of the greatest perennial sellers of our time. His
          fascinating examples include:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Rick Rubin, producer for Adele, Jay-Z, and the Red Hot Chili
          Peppers, who teaches his artists to push past short-term thinking and
          root their work in long-term <br />
          • Tim Ferriss, whose books have sold millions of copies, in part
          because he rigorously tests every element of his work to see what
          generates the strongest response. <br />• Seinfeld, which managed to
          capture both the essence of the nineties and timeless themes to become
          a modern classic.<br />
          • Harper Lee, who transformed a muddled manuscript into To Kill a
          Mockingbird with the help of the right editor and feedback.<br />
          • Winston Churchill, Stefan Zweig, and Lady Gaga, who each learned the
          essential tenets of building a platform of loyal, dedicated
          supporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holiday reveals that the key to success for many perennial sellers is
          that their creators don’t distinguish between the making and the
          marketing. The product’s purpose and audience are in the creator’s
          mind from day one. By thinking holistically about the relationship
          between their audience and their work, creators of all kinds improve
          the chances that their offerings will stand the test of time.
