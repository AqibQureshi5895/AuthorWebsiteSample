          The cult classic that predicted the rise of fake news—revised and
          updated for the post-Trump, post-Gawker age.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nearly 2,300 years after a ruined merchant named Zeno first
          established a school on the Stoa Poikile of Athens, Stoicism has found
          a new audience among those who seek greatness, from athletes to
          politicians and everyone in between. It's no wonder; the philosophy
          and its embrace of self-mastery, virtue, and indifference to that
          which we cannot control is as urgent today as it was in the chaos of
          the Roman Empire.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hailed as "astonishing and disturbing" by the Financial Times and
          "essential reading" by TechCrunch at its original publication, former
          American Apparel marketing director Ryan Holiday’s first book sounded
          a prescient alarm about the dangers of fake news. It's all the more
          relevant today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trust Me, I’m Lying was the first book to blow the lid off the speed
          and force at which rumors travel online—and get "traded up" the media
          ecosystem until they become real headlines and generate real responses
          in the real world. The culprit? Marketers and professional media
          manipulators, encouraged by the toxic economics of the news business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever you see a malicious online rumor costs a company millions,
          politically motivated fake news driving elections, a product or
          celebrity zooming from total obscurity to viral sensation, or
          anonymously sourced articles becoming national conversation, someone
          is behind it. Often someone like Ryan Holiday.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he explains, “I wrote this book to explain how media manipulators
          work, how to spot their fingerprints, how to fight them, and how (if
          you must) to emulate their tactics. Why am I giving away these
          secrets? Because I’m tired of a world where trolls hijack debates,
          marketers help write the news, opinion masquerades as fact, algorithms
          drive everything to extremes, and no one is accountable for any of it.
          I’m pulling back the curtain because it’s time the public understands
          how things really work. What you choose to do with this information is
          up to you.”
