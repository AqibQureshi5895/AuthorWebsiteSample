          The instant Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and international
          bestseller
        </p>

        <p>
          “While the history books are filled with tales of obsessive visionary
          geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost
          irrational force, I’ve found that history is also made by individuals
          who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and
          who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.” —from
          the prologue
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is
          the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our
          ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of
          talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future
          problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more
          difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ego Is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from
          literature to philosophy to his­tory. We meet fascinating figures such
          as George Marshall, Jackie Robinson, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick,
          and Eleanor Roosevelt, who all reached the highest levels of power and
          success by con­quering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics
          can be ours as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          In an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of
          shameless self-promotion, the battle against ego must be fought on
          many fronts. Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes,
          “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own
          specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the
          world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.”
