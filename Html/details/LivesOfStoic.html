          From the bestselling authors of The Daily Stoic comes an inspiring
          guide to the lives of the Stoics, and what the ancients can teach us
          about happiness, success, resilience and virtue.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nearly 2,300 years after a ruined merchant named Zeno first
          established a school on the Stoa Poikile of Athens, Stoicism has found
          a new audience among those who seek greatness, from athletes to
          politicians and everyone in between. It's no wonder; the philosophy
          and its embrace of self-mastery, virtue, and indifference to that
          which we cannot control is as urgent today as it was in the chaos of
          the Roman Empire.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Lives of the Stoics, Holiday and Hanselman present the fascinating
          lives of the men and women who strove to live by the timeless Stoic
          virtues of Courage. Justice. Temperance. Wisdom. Organized in
          digestible, mini-biographies of all the well-known—and not so
          well-known—Stoics, this book vividly brings home what Stoicism was
          like for the people who loved it and lived it, dusting off powerful
          lessons to be learned from their struggles and successes.
        </p>

        <p>
          More than a mere history book, every example in these pages, from
          Epictetus to Marcus Aurelius—slaves to emperors—is designed to help
          the reader apply philosophy in their own lives. Holiday and Hanselman
          unveil the core values and ideas that unite figures from Seneca to
          Cato to Cicero across the centuries. Among them are the idea that
          self-rule is the greatest empire, that character is fate; how Stoics
          benefit from preparing not only for success, but failure; and learn to
          love, not merely accept, the hand they are dealt in life. A treasure
          of valuable insights and stories, this book can be visited again and
          again by any reader in search of inspiration from the past.
