          Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller & Wall Street Journal Bestseller
        </p>

        <p>
          In The Obstacle Is the Way and Ego Is the Enemy, bestselling author
          Ryan Holiday made ancient wisdom wildly popular with a new generation
          of leaders in sports, politics, and technology. In his new book,
          Stillness Is the Key, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist
          philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those
          charging ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
          All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share
          one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To
          avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness
          and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillnessâ€”to be steady
          while the world spins around you.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but
          urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's
          greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich
          Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is
          not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and
          focus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness:
          baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest
          home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his
          busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his
          Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the
          process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what
          was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of
          nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.
        </p>

        <p>
          More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos
          and competition. Stillness Is the Key offers a simple but inspiring
          antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media.
